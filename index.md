### Personal information
My name is Sean Heighway, I’m 27 years old and since graduating high school in 2012 I’ve been working full time in the hospitality and management sectors. I’ve always had a keen interest in all things technology whether it be video games or even just the components used to build and run a computer.  

I come from an all Australian only english speaking family, we are a small but close family who love getting together and celebrating all family milestones and special events throughout the year. As far as my education goes I completed my high school certificate in 2012 and since then have completed a couple of units in a bachelor of nutrition before changing to this IT course to follow my true interests. I love all things cricket and have been playing with the same group of friends for the last 10 years in our local competition and just can’t get enough of it whether it be watching the games on tv or playing every saturday in summer. 
### Interest in IT 
My interest in IT came from a very young age from when I was about 6 years old I remember playing on a very old computer with my dad playing the first Warcraft game that was released and ever since then I’ve had an enormous interest in video games, how they work and how I can get involved in the creating of games. I would say my primary interest in IT is in the gaming sector of it however since learning about python and how to work and code in python I can say that I find it very interesting and satisfying to write a code and see it come to life! 

I chose RMIT because one of my friends recommended them to me and after doing some research I see that it has an awesome reputation and can provide me with everything I need to succeed in a career in IT. 

I expect to learn a lot about IT in particular coding and programming using different languages and how to use that to develop projects such as maybe games and fix real world problems. 
### Ideal Job

 https://careers.blizzard.com/global/en/job/R007754/Mid-Senior-Encounter-Designer-World-of-Warcraft  
This job is to design and implement different encounters and fights into the game ‘world of warcraft’. This position is particularly appealing to me because I’ve been playing this game since I was about 15 and love everything about the lore and fights that happen in this game and to be able to design and create my own part of it would be a dream come true. 

The skills and requirements for this job are a basic knowledge and understanding of the actual game itself, a passion for gaming, multiple years of experience in game development and content creation and game design. The program that is used for world of warcraft is 3D studio max which I will need a firm understanding of to land this job. 

I currently haven’t got any of the required experience or qualifications for this job but simply knowing what needs to be accomplished I can set out a plan and work towards one day having a job like this. In saying this I do however possess some good skills in the form of critical thinking and a creative mind to help with the job. 

My plan to achieve this is to finish this degree with RMIT and work towards learning some programs such as 3d studio max and unity to further increase my chances for a job like this.

My results for the myers briggs test gave me the ISFP result, saying that I'm introverted, observant, feeling and prospecting. The strength of the ”adventurer” personality type are as follows; charming, sensitive to others, imaginative, passionate, curious and artistic. The weaknesses are; unpredictable, independent, easily stressed, competitive and fluctuating self esteem.  

My results for the learning styles was that I’m a tactile learner; meaning that I learn by touching and doing things for myself so that I can get a grasp of what needs to be done. 

I took a creativity test next and scored a 71.59 whereas the average score was 62.87 the graph was skewed more towards paradox and complexity. Paradox meaning I have the ability to both accept and work with statements that are contradictory and Complexity meaning that I have the ability to carry large quantities of information and be able to manipulate and manage the relationships between such information. 

These tests mean that I’m a creative person that works well and understands the needs of others which would make me an ideal team player whilst also being competitive to help bring out both the best in myself and those in my team. When forming a team to work with I would look for other with similar personality types and natures so that we could gel together well and help each other be the best versions of ourselves as a team and deliver the best results possible. I would also look into not grouping up with people that don’t respond well to a competitive nature.  I believe the results based on previous experiences at jobs and social events are very valid and can be used to help form good partnerships for group projects. 
### Project ideas
My project will be a game through using a tool such as unity, I will focus on learning how to make some kind of encounter or “boss fight” style game and will hope to include some kind of mechanics such as evading some form of ability, being able to defeat an opponent and progress through the game with elevating levels of difficulty on completion of each level. Perhaps level one could be as simple as learning a tutorial of the game itself, and as the game progresses more and more degrees of difficulty are added such as ground hazards, and dodging mechanics. 

The motivation for me creating such a project will be to help myself gain some necessary experience and skills in the game development side of IT and hopefully to create a simple but enjoyable game to play and progress through with a feeling of accomplishment as a level is completed. I hope that this game will help to fill in some leisure time for at the very least myself and my friends and to be used as learning experience for myself. 

The features of the game itself would ideally be a game that has some form of combat where the idea is to defeat the “boss” opponent before you are defeated yourself. The combat would ideally be a one where you can avoid attacks from the opponent in order to survive while also evading attacks. With each added victory you gain under your belt, the boss fights would get harder and harder adding an extra element to each fight such as a ground hazard for example the ground you’re standing on constantly gets lit on fire and you need to constantly be moving around to avoid such a thing. If possible I would like to make the game a multiplayer game that can be played online with teammates and friends alike. I would also like to add different modes of combat such as different weapons that can be used to create a different style of combat with each used weapon for example a sword and shield or a Warhammer and even a bow and arrow. The game will primarily feature a single player mode that you work through to end up reaching the top of a castle to defeat the final boss and reclaim the castle that was lost to the enemies you are fighting through the game. The game will likely be a simple 2D game to ensure that I can deliver the project on time and successfully without many setbacks. The first few levels of the game will be an introduction with the basic controls and guide lines on how to navigate through the game. 

 

The skills I'll likely be using to develop the game will be unity, the reason I have chosen unity is after doing some research into programs that can be used to develop games unity was widely recommended and is free to use. It's also described as a simple to use program so that I can hopefully pick it and make the game as good as I possibly can with my current skill level. I’ll look to develop these skills to do such a thing through tools and technologies such as youtube guides and perhaps explore different templates that are already input on unity and hopefully through using guides to learn step by step how to create my game I will accomplish my goal. 

If the project is successful it will go a long way to proving to myself that I have what it takes to not only make it in this industry but thrive and work towards creating a fun experience for everyone that samples my game and hopefully then go on to create more and more and build a portfolio of games so that one day I can work for a company like blizzard or valve to create and change the lives of those who play games that I create. I’ll look to set out a timeframe to have certain stages of the games development done by and keep track and cross off whether or not I make each deadline for each stage of the game.
